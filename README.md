# Language timing

## Intro

_Goal_
Compare the speed of the major languages used in the data science community (R and Python) to that for a rising star (Julia)

_Languages_
* R
* Python
* Julia
 
_Operations_
* Array sorting (quicksort)
* Matrix multiplication (default method for each of the languages)

_Notes_
* base libraries were used for R and Julia
* _numpy_ was used in the case of Python

-----
